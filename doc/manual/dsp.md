# Digital signal processing

`service.dsp` is a synchronous library service for signed 16-bit signal
processing. Callers own FIR, decimator, and FFT contexts. The service does not
run a worker task and does not retain global stream state.

The public operation selects its backend. Applications must not select SIMD
directly. ESP32-S3 builds report `esp32s3-pie` and can use ESP-DSP PIE routines
for eligible gain and window blocks. Other operations, small blocks, unaligned
blocks, and other targets use the portable implementation. `service.engines`
records the operation under the `dsp` owner and reports `cpu` or `simd` use.

## Numeric contract

- Samples, gains, windows, and FIR coefficients are signed 16-bit values.
- Gains, windows, and coefficients use Q15. `32767` is the largest positive
  value and `-32768` represents `-1.0`.
- Products and filter sums use wide accumulators. Scaling divides by 32768,
  rounds toward negative infinity, and saturates to the signed 16-bit range.
- Portable and accelerated paths have the same output contract.
- Exact in-place stateless operations are supported where the input and output
  element counts match. Partial buffer overlap is rejected.
- `level` returns unsigned peak magnitude and integer RMS magnitude.
- FFT input is real signed 16-bit data. Output is interleaved signed 16-bit
  `(real, imaginary)` data. Every radix-2 stage divides by two, so the returned
  exponent is `log2(size)` and the mathematical spectrum equals the returned
  values multiplied by `2 ** exponent`, subject to fixed-point quantization.

FIR coefficient zero multiplies the newest sample. A decimator filters every
input sample and emits the filtered value at phase zero. Its history and phase
continue across calls until `reset`.

## Native API

Include `solar_os_dsp.h`. Stateless operations are:

```c
solar_os_dsp_dot_s16(a, b, count, &dot);
solar_os_dsp_gain_q15(output, input, count, gain_q15);
solar_os_dsp_mix_q15(output, a, b, count, gain_a_q15, gain_b_q15);
solar_os_dsp_clip_s16(output, input, count, minimum, maximum);
solar_os_dsp_level_s16(input, count, &level);
solar_os_dsp_window_q15(output, input, window_q15, count);
```

Streaming processors use caller-owned opaque contexts:

```c
solar_os_dsp_fir_create(coefficients, taps, &fir);
solar_os_dsp_fir_process(fir, output, input, count);
solar_os_dsp_fir_reset(fir);
solar_os_dsp_fir_destroy(fir);

solar_os_dsp_decimator_create(coefficients, taps, factor, &decimator);
solar_os_dsp_decimator_process(decimator, output, capacity,
                               input, count, &produced);
solar_os_dsp_decimator_destroy(decimator);

solar_os_dsp_fft_create(size, &fft);
solar_os_dsp_fft_execute(fft, spectrum, input, &scale_exponent);
solar_os_dsp_fft_destroy(fft);
```

FIR filters support 1 through 1024 taps. FFT sizes must be powers of two from 2
through 4096. One context must not be used concurrently by multiple callers.

Use `solar_os_dsp_backend()`, `solar_os_dsp_capabilities()`, and
`solar_os_dsp_accelerated_capabilities()` for diagnostics. Capability bits are:

| Bit | Operation |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | signed 16-bit dot product |
| 1 | Q15 gain |
| 2 | Q15 mix |
| 3 | signed 16-bit clip |
| 4 | signed 16-bit level |
| 5 | Q15 window |
| 6 | Q15 FIR |
| 7 | Q15 decimator |
| 8 | signed 16-bit FFT |

## Python

Python accepts contiguous buffer objects containing native little-endian
signed 16-bit samples. `array('h')` and `bytearray` objects are suitable.
Stateless output functions return a new `bytearray`:

```python
from array import array
import solaros

dsp = solaros.dsp
samples = array('h', [1000, -1000, 500, -500])

scaled = dsp.gain(samples, 0.5)
mixed = dsp.mix(samples, samples, 0.7, 0.3)
clipped = dsp.clip(samples, -800, 800)
peak, rms = dsp.level(samples)
energy = dsp.dot(samples, samples)
```

`window(samples, coefficients)` returns a new sample buffer. Both inputs must
contain the same number of samples. Gains use floating-point values from `-1.0`
through `1.0` and are converted to Q15.

Stateful processors own their native context and release it during `close()` or
garbage collection:

```python
coefficients = array('h', [16384, 16384])
filt = dsp.fir(coefficients)
filtered = filt.process(samples)

downsample = dsp.fir(coefficients, decimation=4)
low_rate = downsample.process(samples)
downsample.reset()

fft = dsp.fft(1024)
spectrum, exponent = fft.execute(array('h', [0] * 1024))
fft.close()
```

The script bridge accepts at most 32768 samples per call.

## Lua

Lua uses binary strings containing native little-endian signed 16-bit values.
Stateless functions return a new binary string. FIR and FFT constructors return
userdata that own the native context:

```lua
local dsp = solaros.dsp
local scaled = dsp.gain(samples, 0.5)
local peak, rms = dsp.level(samples)

local filt = dsp.fir(coefficients, 4)
local low_rate = filt:process(samples)
filt:reset()
filt:close()

local fft = dsp.fft(1024)
local spectrum, exponent = fft:execute(samples_1024)
```

Lua strings are immutable, so each output operation allocates a new string.
The script bridge accepts at most 32768 samples per call.

## Quick reference

Use `service.dsp` for synchronous fixed-point block processing. The service
selects portable or ESP32-S3 PIE code without application-side board checks.
Callers own streaming contexts and must destroy or close them. Python uses
signed 16-bit buffer objects; Lua uses binary strings. The native Synth service
uses `level` for its captured PCM scope blocks and publishes the resulting peak
and RMS values through Synth status.
