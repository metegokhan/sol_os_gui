# SSH identity keys

SolarOS can keep a default SSH key pair for `ssh` and `scp`. The public key may
be copied to remote hosts; the private key must remain protected.

## Inspect or create a key

```text
sshkey status
sshkey gen 2048
sshkey pub
```

Generating a key may take time and memory. Without `-f`, an existing key is not
overwritten.

## Protect private material

Do not print, copy, edit, or delete the private key unless the user explicitly
requests that exact operation. The agent's storage tools reject paths below
`.ssh`.

## Quick reference

solaros.ssh_keys provides default_paths, default_exists, status, generate
(optional bits and overwrite), and remove when SSH is installed. Do not
inspect, expose, replace, or delete private key material unless the user
explicitly requests that operation.
